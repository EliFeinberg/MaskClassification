# MaskClassification
Original a CS196 Project, we built a lightweight fully automated Mask Face detector that can parse live video streams to determine whether or not people are wearing Face Masks.

# Todo:
- [ ] Detect incorrect mask wearing
- [ ] Increase Framerate
- [ ] Deploy with a JS Frontend
- [ ] Record Footage
